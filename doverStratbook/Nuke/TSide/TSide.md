_Pistol Round: Cinnamon Swirl_
1 person buys flashes and a smoke, everyone else buys kevlar. 4 Rush ramp with flashes on the fly, one lurks lobby to prevent pushes. Once heaven, lurker pushes hut and all except last drop to A site. If possible, smoke mini. Try to get into good afterplant positions (hut, asia, squeaky, outside vents, back site, etc).

_Default_
Player 1 (Peter) Smokes Close, goes outside
Player 2 (Zack) Smokes Far, walks back into lobby
Player 3 Smokes cross, goes outside
Player 4 Walks into lobby, holds ramp
Player 5 Lurks outside, maybe down into secret

Main idea is to get enough information to be able to call a strat mid round

_Fast Secret_
Default Smokes
4 Players down secret
1 Player lurks lobby, can walk ramp or try to get exit kills
Once down, bomb goes single door with 1 other person, others go into control.
Try to plant behind silo, get trades

_Ramp Take (Fnatic 4-1)_
Default Smokes
1 Player makes noise or lurks outside
Other players regroup in lobby and walk toward ramp (while holding pushes)
1 Player with 2 flashes jumps across, calling anything they see, then flashes twice off the angled wall. The flashes need to land deep enough that they don't blind us.
We go after the first flash and stick to the right wall before we get out of trophy.
If possible, smoke hell.
If we kill ramp, we drop to B, otherwise, we go hell.
IF B, smoke off control, moly single door. Plant along the wall opposite double doors.
If hell, contest outside while we climb into heaven. Then go A.

_A Take_
Default smokes
3 Players in lobby

- 1 break and hold squeaky
- 1 hold hut
- 1 hold ramp
  , 1 Lurk outside, goal of regrouping through mini.
  1 Player t roof throwing nades.
  On call, squeaky smokes mini, then flashes into mini twice.
  other 2 get ready to go out hut.
  I throw 2 flashes, pop out on the 2nd flash.
  First out has to clear above hut. Second can trade or clear backsite.
  Plant for mini, resmoke mini.
