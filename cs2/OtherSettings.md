# Other Settings

### NVIDIA Control Panel (Suck it AMD)

1. Adjust image settings with preview

- - Balanced [^1]

2. Manage 3D Settings>Program Settings>cs2.exe

- - Low Latency Mode: On [^2]

[^1]: (Pro players like Elige use Performance)
[^2]: (Not Ultra. This setting constantly changes, do some research. In some cases it does nothing. In some cases/early cs2 versions having on Ultra hurts performance. Do some research. I'm too lazy to change.)

- - Texture filtering quality: high Performance

- - Vsync: off

3. Adjust desktop color settings

- - Digital vibrance: 70%

## In game video settings

For things with multiple values, choose what looks better. Usually the lower end is the minimum to not be at disadvantage, higher is for looking better. I got these settings mostly from Elige and he plays on the lower side.

1. 4:3 1920x1440, 144 hz on a 27" monitor.

- - (This doesn't matter, [play at the res ur comfortable with])
- - for 4:3, change `m_yaw .0165` in console
- - for 16:9 `m_yaw .022`
- - for 16:10 `choose a different resolution weirdo`

2. Boost Player Contrast: Enabled
3. Wait for Vsync: Disabled
4. MSAA: 4x
5. Global Shadow Quality: (High/Very High)
6. Model/Texture Detail: (High/Very High)
7. Texture Filtering: Bilinear
8. Shader Detail: (Low/High)
9. Particle Detail: (Low/High)
10. Ambient Occlusion: (Medium/High)
11. HDR: Quality
12. Nvidia Reflex Low Latency: Enabled (do some research, this could change.)

## Ingame Sound

I might not have all sound settings in autoexec. Most of these settings are subjective, but I'll put a '\*' next to them if they're important.

1. EQ Profile: Crisp
2. LR Isolation: 100% (I played at 15% for past year, experimenting rn)
3. Perspective Correction: Yes. (Elige plays with this off.)
4. Round Start, Action, End, Bomb/Hostage vol @ 0, I find these annoying. Definitely have 10 second warning on.
5. Mute MVP Music when players on both teams are alive: Yes

## Hardware

as of 1/31/24

- Mouse: Logitech G Pro X Superlight (I don't like how light it is.)
- Mousepad: Some steelseries .5mm thick mousepad. (It's heavy and nice, but any mousepad works I don't really care.)
- Headset: Logitech G Pro X Wireless
- Logitech G413 SE Mechanical Keyboard (I hate the nondetachable cable. It's big and bulky and gets in the way with my monitor stand. USB C would have been much better)
- Monitor: Acer XG270HU 144hz 1440p 1ms response time, it's fine. I don't have much to compare it too.
